## What I learned through this Project?

- Web Sockets and Socket.IO: Throughout this project, I learned about Web Sockets and their implementation using Socket.io. Including broadcasting messages to multiple clients, handling different events, implementing acknowledgments, and handling disconnect and error events.
- Context API: I also learned about the Context API as part of this project. I gained an understanding of how to use it in React to manage global state and share data between components without the need for prop drilling
- UI with Chakra UI: I learned to build a user-friendly UI design using Chakra UI.
